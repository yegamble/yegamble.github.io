	<p align="left" class="notice"><strong>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:</strong> If you are requesting a key signature and <strong>your current physical location</strong> is <strong>NOT</strong> within <strong>Canada, United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, or New Zealand</strong>, it is required that you encrypt all initial and continuing communication regarding key signing. Encryption also required if you are utilizing any stationary or mobile connection located on national civil or defence installations that are within or outside of the administered borders of the countries mentioned.</p>

<p><em>This message has been signed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://pastebin.com/raw/v3iBUs6Q">http://pastebin.com/raw/v3iBUs6Q</a></span>.Please verify that the signature is valid with <a href="https://keybase.io/yegamble/key.asc">my public key</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer</span>
<p>By requesting a digital key signature from myself, you understand that open source information is a part of the investigation process required for key signing. Also, you understand that all personal, open source, and private information may be logged and stored digitally for archival purposes. I reserve the right to store collected information by all means necessary in order to protect the integrity of my communications and the Web of Trust. Any persons found to have abused encryption in order to carry out illegal activities will be reported to the proper authorities immediately.</p>
<strong><h2>Summary</h2></strong>
<p>This policy outlines the basic standards and procedures for key signing. If you are unfamiliar with key signing, please consult <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKeysigning&amp;h=kAQH7Cj9x">this article</a>. The reasons that you would want me to sign your key is up to you. Send an email to <a href="mailto:yosef.gamble@protonmail.com" target="_blank">yosef.gamble@protonmail.com</a>. I will always take the proper steps to ensure that your message is not intercepted.</p>
<p>Continue below to learn the different identity certifications. For people that I know, I will usually sign your key in person. If I do not know you, you must satisfy the requirements for a casual or positive certification. Your ability to satisfy an approved certification level does not guarantee that your key will be signed.</p>
<p>Specifications for approval may vary on a case by case basis. Keybase.io is not a substitute for this verification process.</p>
<br><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Certification Levels</span></p>
<p><strong>0 (ZE-ro)</strong> &ndash; Generic Certification</p>
<p><strong>1 (Wun)</strong> &ndash; Persona Certification</p>
<p><strong>2 (Too)</strong> &ndash; Casual Certification</p>
<p><strong>3 (Three)</strong> &ndash; Positive Certification</p>
<br>
<h2>Generic Certification</h2>
<p>No or very little knowledge of identity. <strong>This certification does not pass the minimum set of specifications for key signing.</strong></p>
<br><h2>Persona Certification</h2>
<p>Weak knowledge of identity and limited personal details such as residency and limited knowledge of associates. <strong>This certification does not pass the minimum set of specifications for key signing.</strong></p>
<br><h2>Casual Certification</h2>
<p>Intermediate knowledge of identity through monetary exchange, personal acquaintance, or referral.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will sign your key if we meet in person and exchange government-issued identification and key fingerprints if we don't know each other.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I will sign your key using live video conferencing using uTox and sharing government issued identification. My Tox ID is 6D94A0F6BA34F47B5720CF039DF454623DB47322F79F2E90A0E63B72D95E053D4AA158F110A6. I am not interested in using centralized chat protocols, such as Ekiga, Jitsi, Skype, Google Hangouts, Facetime, etc.</li><br>
<li>I will sign your key if we cannot meet in person but someone I ultimately trust notifies me that you want a signature, and gives me your key ID verbally or in person.</li><br>
<li>I will sign your key without meeting in person and without exchanging identification and key fingerprints if I know you very well personally (such as working with you, attending uni with you, family, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<br><h2>Positive Certification</h2>
<p>Strong knowledge of identity and confident about all presented documents and details of key signature requestor.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Certification Method:</strong></p>
<p>Present a colour copy of your passport or driver&rsquo;s licence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a colour scan of your <em>government issued</em> ID card, passport, or driver's license.</li>
<li>On the colour scan, <em>handwrite</em> your email address and your key id.</li>
<li>Compose an email with the resulting document, and digitally sign it with your key.</li>
<li>Send the email to: <a href="mailto:yosef.gamble@protonmail.com" target="_blank">yosef.gamble@protonmail.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Copies of verified government documents will be destroyed once the investigation is complete. In order to mitigate identity fraud, you may black out your social security number, passport number, and/or driver&rsquo;s licence number. Because we aren&rsquo;t meeting face-to-face, the photo isn&rsquo;t necessary, but it will help expedite the process to verify your identity. I&rsquo;ll remain in contact with you if too much information is removed from government issued identification, or if your scan is unclear. Please encrypt your email and scans to ensure that I am the only person who sees your information. All unencrypted copies of information will be destroyed.</p>
<p><em>I currently do not support PayPal verification.</em></p>
